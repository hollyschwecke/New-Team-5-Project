## Vision Statement

* Our product's goal is to track inventory levels of a pet supply website for business optimization. It will seamlessly integrate with their website to ensure inventory levels are always accurate to minimize operational disruptions. 

## Motivation

* From personal experience with insufficient software and current market offerings for pet digital storefronts, we wanted to improve inventory tracking efficiency. This will provide customers with a less frustrating and more enjoyable experience when shopping for our fur babies. This system creates a fresh take on typical inventory management systems that is more user-oriented and secure when updating inventory levels.

## Risks to project completion

* Learning new languages: HTML, CSS, SQL
* Using outdated software
* Schedule conflicts
  
## Mitigation Strategy for above risks

* Using jupyterhub to help with having download software
* Have discussions about meeting times, recording meetings if someone can't make it
* Bouncing ideas off each other
* Finding resources to learn languages

## Development method

* Use of Kanban boards with weekly scrum meetings to keep track of progress

## Project Tracking Software
