### Final Status Report:
- **Completed:** The HTML, CSS, and Javascript web pages for the website were completed and hooked up to the web hosting service we used (Render). Additionally, the basic database structure was outlined and a few items were inserted into the database. These tasks took a long time with many hiccups, but were able to be completed on time, despite the group needing personnel restructing in the middle of the semester.
- **In the middle of implementing:** We were in the middle of making sure the database connects to each web page properly. The database doesn't connect to most of the web pages as it should, thus we were working on fixing the issue. Right now a bandaid fix of manually adding things to the database was done for demonstration purposes.
- **Plans for future:** We plan to add more tables and entries to the tables in the database, adding complexity and extra functionality to the website for ease of use for users. Additionally, we have plans to work on the security for logging in and creating accounts by making sure usernames and passwords are escaped and not as susceptible to amultitude of attacks such as SQL injection attacks. With more time and less hiccups with our current status of the project could have let us to explore this topic more.
- **Known issues and bugs:** The database is not currently correctly working with the Products table and other tables in terms of intended user functionality. It won't connect properly and as intended to add products, search specific items, and more despite our best efforts to debug and fix this issue.

Overall, with a simpler project design and implementation some of the issues and bugs could have been fixed more easily and made a cleaner project. Due to the short nature of the project and the group restructuring during the middle of the semester due to interpersonal group issues, this is the amount of work we put in for this product.
